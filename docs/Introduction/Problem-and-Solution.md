# Problem and Solution

## The Problem

Traditional prediction markets face several issues:

| Problem                 | Impact                            |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Lack of transparency    | Users cannot verify outcomes      |
| High barriers to entry  | Complex onboarding, high minimums |
| Limited social features | No friend groups or communities   |
| Platform control        | Centralized decision making       |

## The Predictly Solution

Predictly addresses these problems with a decentralized, social-first approach:

### Transparent and Decentralized

| Opaque resolution   | Transparent judge system      |
